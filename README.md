### Analysis of factors influencing attitudes towards abortion based on joint WVS/EVS data
----

This is the R code from my term paper, which I wrote during the first year of my master's program. It is based on the joint dataset from the World Values Survey and the European Values Survey (https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSEVSjoint2017.jsp).

**Abstract:** The study analyses factors influencing attitudes towards abortion using combined
WVS/EVS data (2017-2022, 92 countries, N > 150,000). Based on cultural modernisation theory
and the authoritarian attitudes model, the study focuses on the role of patrimonialism (loyalty to
the nation, family, and state authority) as a key predictor. The results of a two-stage multilevel
regression analysis confirm that high levels of patrimonialism are significantly associated with
more negative attitudes toward abortion. Religiosity was found to be the strongest negative factor
at the individual level, while higher education, income, and support for gender equality
contribute to greater tolerance. The hypothesis that the link between patrimonialism and
opposition to abortion is stronger in the most modernised countries was only partially confirmed:
this effect is evident among respondents who accept abortion in certain cases, but not among
radical opponents. The study contributes to the understanding of value conflicts surrounding
reproductive rights in a global context.
